# FedBiomed-Federated-Learning-Experiments
In this practical session, we will explore federated learning using the open-source framework Fed-BioMed by setting up and running a small federated learning experiment. Throughout the tutorial, we will experiment with some of the key parameters of the framework, gaining hands-on experience with how they affect the training process.
